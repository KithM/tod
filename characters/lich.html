        <h2>The Lich (BBEG)</h2>
        <p>Once a revered Magi (Magister Eldryn), celebrated for his unparalleled wisdom and formidable power, he met a tragic demise. In the aftermath of his downfall, the Undying Cult chose to reanimate him as a Lich, intending to unleash vengeance upon the lands. He now exists as an unwilling pawn, an escalating menace to the realm.</p>
